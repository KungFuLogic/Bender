# Bender
.NET 3D Graphics Transformation Stack

This is an old project of mine. Essentially Bender is a transformation stack. Some parts are generic and my intention was to implement it towards different 3D frameworks.
In the end I only implemented it towards the Managed Direct X (MDX) library.

I'm making it available here if anyone is looking for a generalized transformation stack to use in their project. Extending it with an implementation towards some other 3D framework in .NET should be rather simple.
